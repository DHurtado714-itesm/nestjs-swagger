# 🚀 NestJS Project with Swagger Documentation and Route Filtering

This project is built using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. It integrates [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) for automatic API documentation generation and includes route filtering based on paths, allowing for the creation of multiple files depending on the route path.

## ✨ Features

- **NestJS Framework**: Utilizes NestJS for building robust, testable, and scalable server-side applications.
- **Swagger Integration**: 📝 Automatically generates interactive API documentation using Swagger.
- **Route Filtering by Paths**: 🚦 Supports route filtering and separation by paths.
- **Dynamic File Generation**: 🗂️ Capable of generating multiple files depending on the specified path.
